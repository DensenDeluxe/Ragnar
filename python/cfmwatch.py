cfmwatch - passive IEEE 802.1ag CFM / ITU-T Y.1731 service-OAM detector.

Part of the Ragnar passive network security suite.

SCOPE
-----
EtherType 0x8902 (Connectivity Fault Management), including the Y.1731
service-OAM overlay (AIS/LCK/CSF, APS, LB/LT, LM/DM/SL, TST, EXM/VSM).
Rides inside the service VLAN on EVC trunks; 802.1Q and QinQ are parsed.

Sibling module, NOT an oamwatch enhancement. oamwatch covers 802.3ah Link
OAM (EtherType 0x8809) - different EtherType, different destination group,
different grammar, different state machine, different threat model.
oamwatch's README declares CFM out of its scope; that stays true. Do not
wire a CFM dissector into oamwatch's tests, and do not wire a Link OAM
dissector into this module's tests.

PASSIVE ONLY
------------
This module never transmits. No LBM, no LTM, no MEP probing, no active
verification of any kind. There is no CFM transmitter in this tree; the
lab borrows tcpreplay to inject pre-built pcaps. A transmit-guard AST scan
(tier 3) enforces this against the source.

DUAL STACK
----------
Not applicable, and recorded here explicitly so it never reads as an
oversight: CFM is a pure L2 protocol carried directly over Ethernet with
its own EtherType. There is no IP header and therefore no IPv4/IPv6
address-family split to achieve parity across. Same disposition as
oamwatch and lacpwatch. The Ragnar dual-stack prime directive is satisfied
by "IPv6 where applicable"; it is not applicable here.

CVE BACKBONE
------------
CVE-2020-1639   7.5  Juniper Junos, crafted Ethernet OAM packet -> CFM
                     daemon overflow and core. JSA11020. Structural spine.
CVE-2025-52961  6.5  Junos OS Evolved PTX, adjacent device sends valid
                     traffic -> cfmd 100% CPU, cfmman leak, FPC crash.
                     Volumetric; weak as a single-frame signature.
CVE-2014-3223   7.5  Huawei S-series Y.1731 DoS. Trigger field never
                     published - screening row only, no detector claim.

Rejected and not to be re-proposed: CVE-2023-20233 (Cisco IOS XR CFM,
4.3, below the 6.5 bar, not in KEV).

class Ring:
    """An operator-declared ERPS ring.

    Baseline dependence is the central problem for ring rules: a
    legitimate protection switch and a forged R-APS are identical on the
    wire without the declared topology. This follows the pattern already
    proven in vrfwatch's interface-role declaration - the operator
    declares, an undeclared plane fails loud and raises its own finding,
    presence rules stay quiet while structural rules remain armed.

    G.8032v2 interconnected topologies need three more declared facts,
    because each one decides whether an observed event is normal:

      role/parent   a sub-ring attaches to a parent ring at
                    interconnection nodes.
      interconnect  ONLY an interconnection node legitimately propagates
                    a topology change, and propagation runs one way:
                    toward the ring the sub-ring connects to, never into
                    a sub-ring.
      vc            with a virtual channel the sub-ring's R-APS travels
                    over the parent between the interconnection nodes;
                    without one it must not appear there at all.
      revertive     revertive operation is CONFIGURATION ONLY in G.8032 -
                    it is not carried in R-APS - so a non-revertive ring
