"""
DNS Doctor mDNS tier (RFC 6762 multicast DNS / RFC 6763 DNS-SD).

TWO LEGS, kept separate because they answer different questions:

  CENSUS (DNSD-070..073) -- what Matter and Thread infrastructure
  exists on this LAN. Informational, never an alarm. This exists
  because Ragnar can see Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, Wi-Fi HaLow,
  MeshCore, Meshtastic, BLE and Classic, but had no way to know
  Matter existed at all. Matter's operational traffic on UDP 5540 is
  encrypted per session, so mDNS discovery is the only cleartext
  plane that names it -- and it works over Wi-Fi and Ethernet without
  any 802.15.4 radio, including devices sitting behind a Thread
  border router.

  SCOPE (DNSD-074..076) -- the RFC 6762 transport rules, which is the
  CERT VU#550620 family: responders that answer off-link become
  amplification reflectors and leak their whole service inventory.

WHAT THIS TIER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: judge whether an mDNS answer
is legitimate. smbwatch already owns LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS name poisoning
(Responder/Inveigh). Both modules see the same packets; only smbwatch
reports spoofing. This one judges scope and census only, so there is
no double report and no disagreement between two detectors about the
same frame.

WHY THE AVAHI CVEs ARE ABSENT: the remote crafted-packet bugs
(CVE-2008-5081 source-port-0 assertion, CVE-2010-2244 checksum crash,
CVE-2011-1002 empty-packet loop) are all 2006-2011 and score ~5.0 on
CVSS v2, under the 6.5 floor. CVE-2008-5081 has a Metasploit module
and high EPSS but is not in CISA KEV, so no exception applies. The
2023 and 2025 Avahi CVEs are local D-Bus resource exhaustion -- not
on the wire at all, so not passively detectable by construction.

    weaker than it looks: the service type says the device is
    commissionABLE, while CM says whether the window is open RIGHT NOW.
    A device can advertise the service with CM=0. So DNSD-077 is the
    authoritative statement and DNSD-071 is the hint, which is why one
    is a warning and the other a notice.

    WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CLAIMED: the difference between CM=1 and
    CM=2. Both are non-zero and both mean the window is open; which
    one corresponds to which commissioning method, and whether either
    uses the factory-printed passcode, could not be established from a
    source that stated it plainly. So the raw value goes in the
    evidence and the finding claims only what CM=0-versus-non-zero
    supports. Naming CM=2 "the weaker mode" in a detail string would
    have been a guess an operator then acts on.

    SUPPRESSION INCLUDES THE CM VALUE, so a window opening and closing
    re-reports once per state change rather than once per announcement
    -- mDNS devices re-announce constantly, and a commissioning window
    is precisely the transient an operator wants the edges of.
