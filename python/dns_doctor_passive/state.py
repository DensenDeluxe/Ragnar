"""
Per-zone state: LRU-capped, ring-buffered, EMA baselines.

MEMORY DISCIPLINE (Pi Zero 2W floor, 512 MB): every per-zone
structure is FIXED SIZE. __slots__ everywhere, deques with maxlen,
floats rather than history lists. Nothing here grows with traffic
volume -- only with the number of distinct zones, which is capped.

THE GRAB-AND-GO PROBLEM, stated plainly because it shapes this file:

Ragnar's deployment model is arrive-at-a-site-and-plug-in, with no
per-site tuning. That is the documented reason snmpwatch was rejected
-- not its false-positive rate as such, but that reducing the rate
required weeks of per-customer baseline learning, which the model
cannot supply.

Three detectors in this tier (DNSD-020 DNSBomb, DNSD-021 NSEC3
encloser, DNSD-022 water torture) are baseline-dependent in exactly
that way. They are implemented, but they are:

  1. OFF by default (Config.enable_baseline_detectors = False), and
  2. even when enabled, structurally incapable of emitting until
     their zone's baseline is WARM -- which requires both a minimum
     observation count and a minimum wall-clock duration.

So a grab-and-go deployment gets the eleven structural, posture and
integrity findings immediately and silently skips the three that
would otherwise fire on an unlearned baseline. A permanently-sited
sensor (the stealth Pi, an MSP desktop node) can turn them on and
will start getting them once warm. The operator is never shown a
behavioural finding derived from a baseline that does not exist yet.
