"""
Hand-rolled dual-stack DNS parser for DNS Doctor's passive tier.

No regex, no dnspython on the hot path -- per the Pi Zero 2W budget.
Pure bytes in, structured records out. Every function is total: it
returns a MalformedDNS marker rather than raising, because a passive
sensor that crashes on hostile input is worse than one that misses a
packet, and malformed packets are themselves a finding (DNSD-007).

THREE THINGS THIS FILE GETS RIGHT ON PURPOSE, each a known trap:

1. COMPRESSION POINTER LOOPS. A name can point backwards to another
   name. Two pointers aimed at each other hang a naive parser forever
   -- a one-packet CPU denial of service against the sensor itself.
   Guarded two ways: pointers must strictly DECREASE (a pointer may
   only ever point earlier in the message), and a hard jump budget.
   The strictly-decreasing rule is the stronger of the two and is what
   makes a loop structurally impossible rather than merely bounded.

2. FORWARD POINTERS ARE REJECTED. RFC 1035 s4.1.4 defines compression
   as a pointer to a PRIOR occurrence. Forward pointers are a classic
   parser-differential evasion: some stacks follow them, some don't,
   so an attacker can make one name mean two things to two readers.

3. OFFSET ARITHMETIC IS DUAL-STACK BUT NOT DUPLICATED. The IPv4 and
   IPv6 paths differ only in where the L4 header starts; everything
   above that is one code path, because DNS records are byte-identical
   over either. The version nibble decides the offset and nothing else
   branches -- so there is no second implementation to drift.

#      16 name bytes into two 4-bit nibbles and maps each to 'A'+nibble,
#      producing 32 printable characters that then travel as ONE
#      ordinary DNS label. A DNS parser reads that label fine and
#      returns gibberish -- "EJFDEBFEEBFACACACACACACACACACAAA" rather
#      than "WPAD".
#   2. OPCODE 5 means NAME REGISTRATION here, while in DNS it means
#      UPDATE (RFC 2136). So NBNS traffic reaching the opcode router
#      would be read as a dynamic update, and a registration storm
#      would be reported as unsigned dynamic updates being accepted.
